# Rotoscoping

simple rotoscoping effect with [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).

(gifs here are a little bit too large (max is 3.7MB, average ~1.2MB), be patient ðŸ˜‰).

## Example 1

### Original (5s)
![./gifs/original/example1.gif](./gifs/original/example1.gif)

### Result (5s)
![./gifs/results/example1.gif](./gifs/results/example1.gif)

### How to 
- extract frames from your video 
- compose new frames like this : 

| new video frames | composition           |
| ---------------- |:---------------------:| 
| frame 1          | frame 1               |
| frame 2          | frame 2               |
| frame 3         Â | frame 3               |
| ...              | ...                   |
|Â frame x          | frame x + frame 1     |
|Â frame (x+1)      | frame (x+1) + frame 2 |
|Â frame (x+2)      | frame (x+2) + frame 3 |
| ...              |Â ...                   |
- create video from new frames

## Example 2

### Original (30s)
![./gifs/original/example2.gif](./gifs/original/example2.gif)

### Result (15s)
![./gifs/results/example2.gif](./gifs/results/example2.gif)

### How to 
- split by 2 your video into 2 videos with same length of time (part1, part2)
- extract frames from the 2 new videos 
- compose new frames like this : 

| new video frames | composition                                           |
| ---------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------:| 
| frame 1          | (frame 1 from part1) + (frame 1 from part2)           |
| frame 2          | (frame 2 from part1) + (frame 2 from part2)           |
| frame 3          | (frame 3 from part1) + (frame 3 from part2)           |
| ...              | ...                                                   |
- create video from new frames


## Bonus 

If you change a little bit the first script's example you can create a real chronophotography.

* start your loop at 2 and use composite with the previous frame*
